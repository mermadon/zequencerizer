He grabs a pair of jeans, two pairs of socks and underpants, a toothbrush and his logging boots.

As Harper emails the LINK to her phone, Zayne walks in behind her, shoving snacks into his mostly empty backpack. 

HARPER

ZAYNE
Hey Ford! Do me a favor?

EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - NEARBY

A LINE OF ARMORED SUVS hurtles down the iced over gravel road. An ARMORED CARRIER rides at the center. 

INT. ARMORED CARRIER

The carrier is dark, save for the shifting light from the HATCH overhead. In the shadows of the carrier, something BREATHES. A man. Two men? A beast? Something huge and heavy, something //merged.//

Zayne hustles the kids toward A LIFTED PINTO.  33s and snow chains: late 80s Big Cam Cummins protruding through a jagged hole in the hood. It's like something out of Mad Max, but with worse welders.

HARPER
Do you speak //any// Spanish? Have you ever even left Montana?

The jacked up Pinto CHURNS through freshly falling snow, storm clouds gathering overhead.

In the passenger seat, Harper transcribes Malachi's video, referencing the CODEX.

''The front door SMASHES in.'' Yara strides inside, flanked by MILITARY men. 

As they DESTROY THE HOUSE, her gaze locks on the FORD-SMASHED COMPUTER.

Zayne ACCELERATES around a corner, gliding through the snow. In the rattling car, Harper struggles to transcribe Max's message with pencil.

As the truck pulls into a REMOTE DESERT TEMPLE SITE (think Chan Chan but less excavated), Zayne is drug from the truck and drug to someone's feet. 

He looks up to see ATOC. 

Zayne demands to see his brother, to know that he's safe, but ATOC just smiles. 

ATOC (IN SPANISH)
So your Malachi sends for his brother. As like... a back up plan? And so I'm thinking. Holy shit, his brother, he must be this badass, maybe military, maybe cop? But damn. Look at this. 

His men laugh. 

ATOC (IN SPANISH)
Some washed up redneck? Damn. 
(then, in english)
Do you understand that you are stupid? Do you understand that?

:: WHAT HAPPENED {"position":"575,1550"}
Zayne rubs his head. 

ZAYNE
What happened?

:: JESUS JUNGLE {"position":"950,25"}
Jesus lifts the MACHETE out of Z's bag.

JESUS
Â¡A Su! SeÃ±or //Indiana Jones!//

He waves the machete like he's slashing vines, making Omar cackle. Zayne grimaces. Shit. Omar starts throwing Zayne's clothes overboard. But then, he comes across the $shirt shirt.

:: TAXI {"position":"1900,225"}

Zayne has a choice

[[TRY TO ESCAPE]] | [[GO ALONG WITH THE PLAN]]

:: TRY TO ESCAPE {"position":"725,525"}

He asks to go pee. 

Later you have a choice. 

[[RUN OFF]] | [[GO TO THE TRUNK]]

:: GO ALONG WITH THE PLAN {"position":"350,550"}

In this version, you're AMBUSHED by the police. Anna is the cop. 

You're brought to a complicated choice between Anna and Edwin. He's arrested as a black market smuggler. 

:: RUN OFF {"position":"150,750"}

Some version of big adventure by yourself. Maybe sacred valley. 

[[SOME FUNNY ENDING]]

:: SOME FUNNY ENDING {"position":"475,425"}

He wanders the scared valley - in the chachapoya highlands h<<else>>
    
[[NO DRUGS FOR ME]] | [[TAKES THE DRUGS]]

:: NO DRUGS FOR ME {"position":"225,750"}

Uncomfortable, Zayne decides to leave. 

WEEKS LATER.

Its all over... Zayne emerges from the brush. 

Malachi, I'm here to save you. Bring you home. 

He's looking out over a HELLSCAPE he created. 

[[RETURN|GO TO THE TRUNK]]

:: TAKES THE DRUGS {"position":"1000,575"}

He is forced to confront his childhood trauma. 

His reasons for being out here. 

He becomes a shaman. 

And his body is enshrined in a tomb on a cliffside. 

[[RETURN|GO TO THE TRUNK]]

:: GO TO THE TRUNK {"position":"725,650"}

ZAYNE
I know he's in there!

He thinks it's his brother in there. It's not. It's Edwin. 

Or, they're attacked. You can try to escape or go with the people who attacked you. 



:: THREATEN TO KILL EDWIN
Edwin then threatens to Kill Z. 

And for some reason, this works. They want Z alive. 



They get their asses kicked. 

Zayne gets put in the trunk too. 

CUT TO:

They're drug out, put in a HOLDING room. He finds out his brother was here. But he's not trusted anymore. He like to play fast and loose with alliances. The truth is, they thought they knew where it was... but 

Under an archeological dig. At a desert place like SIPAN. 

To gain his trust, Z has to grow in some way. 

[[BE SELF DEPRECATING]] | [[SHOW YOUR NERD]]

:: BE SELF DEPRECATING

Z makes some joke about being a dumb redneck: all this is pretty over my head. 

Fail

[[SHOW YOUR NERD]]

:: SHOW YOUR NERD

Z starts to open up about all the things he was interested in as a child. 

He used to be into archeology, he actually got Malachi into it. This works, Edwin starts to tell him that he knows Malachi isn't all bad, but he's over my head. 

They accused me of selling artifacts on the black market.

ZAYNE
Did you do it?

EDWIN
Of course I did. That's what we were doing... how do you think your American museums.. lemme ask you a question... who do you think is the biggest holder of Mayan antiquities in the entire world?
(beat)
The University of Pennsylvania. I shit you not. 

He says he grew up doing it. You're poor, you sell. When he was older, he fought against but 

EDWIN is convinced he has to destroy these artifacts before anyone finds them. Because if they know, the whole world will be destroyed. 

ZAYNE
Yeah, I'm no expert, but that seems wrong. 

EDWIN
It's trolly problem where, on one side, you have very nice, very important cultural artifacts, and on the other, you have the entire population of the human race. It's not that pinche morally complicated. 

[[HELP HIM]] | [[USE EDWIN AS LEVERAGE|USE EDWIN]]

:: USE EDWIN

Use him as leverage to get to see your brother. 

Turn him in to Anna to get the help you need getting to your brother. 

ZAYNE
This is the guy you want. Malachi is just... he's a stupid kid, he gets ideas... 

ANNA
Zayne... your brother... 

ZAYNE
I'm not making excuses, I'm not saying he hasn't screwed up. I'm just asking you to do this for me. I'm gonna get you what you want. You help me too. Nothing is perfect, but it's better for both of us than where we sit right now. 

That gets you to the MEETING the same as if you and Anna part ways. 

:: HELP HIM {"position":"825,375"}

To break out, if he's wearing the Reba one of the guards notices it, tells him his mom used to love Reba. (or he thinks it's Florence nad the Machine) WE see he's a tender kid. 

KID
That's the night the lights went out in Georgia... 

Or it lets Edwin him go pee, not in a bucket. 

It leads to a whole easter egg branch where they sneak out through a TUNNEL where Edwin sees something he's never seen before. 

Maybe there's another worker there, selling squid or calf brains GUINEA PIGS - they still roast and eat them - EDWIN, oh yeah, they emperors would make coats out of them. Blankets. Whole appartments decorated with the pelts of guinea pigs 

He chews, grease flying. Z looks like he's gonna throw up. 

ZAYNE has to pretend to be a tour guide, has to distract 

the tourists. He's really bad at it, he's failing until he asks if anybody wants to see a secret exhibit. 

[[SHOW THEM THE PORN]] | [[TELL THEM THE GOLD]]

:: SHOW THEM THE GOLD

The kids start screaming
It fails. They get caught, executed in the desert. 

EDWIN
This is how Z dies. By my side. Two idiots, who didn't have the brains to survive. 

Or maybe Malachi watches and we learn something interesting about him. 

[[SHOULDA JUST SHOWED THE PORN | SHOW THEM THE PORN]]

:: SHOW THEM THE PORN

This one obviously works. Zayne shows the group the hilariously explicit pottery of the moche people. 

He also has a realization - he has a lot of hangups himself. 

These are people who just enjoyed pleasure, and found sex funny and interesting and something worth talking about... 

But then, edwin runs in being CHASED by armed guards. 

If you've made RELATIONSHIPS with people, they defend you. How does that fit the theme? If you've eaten food they offered you?

[[eat the pig]] [[don't eat the pig]]

:: don't eat the pig

he sneaks out the back, takes one of them with him as a pet. 

INSANE ENDING

He runs off, almost starves to death

ZAYNE
I prayed to God, I said Jesus, I'm sorry, I looked a gift pig in the mouth, and I promise, give me another chance, i'll do better. 

All night, I just dreamed of those guinea pigs, laughing at me. 

He opens a chain of restaurants. They get caught, people are incensed. 

:: eat the pig

he takes a bite. 

Maybe he's super hungry at this point. 

It's actually deliscious. 

but then he looks at it. 

He has to escape with the guinea pig lady. He has to eat it, and really enjoy it. 

He rescues one of the guinea pigs from her house. 

CUY

He and Edwin get in a big disagreement about Malachi. Edwin thinks he can't be saved, not direclty, if you want to save him, you have to stop him. 

ZAYNE
He sent the code. The rainy day code. He's never done that before. 

EDWIN
I thought you didn't care about the fucking code, dude. I thought you were a tough guy, remember? You don't care what happens to him... you care that your role in his story is a glorious one. He needs help. Not another cowboy entrance.  You both need help. 

He's refusing to ever die and you're refusing to even live the one life you're ever had. I only eat ketchup and chicken, what is that shit. WHy are you afraid of liking things?

ZAYNE
It's called being NORMAL, why doesn't everyone want me to be weird all the time. 

EDWIN
BEING in pain is normal! Being scared is normal! Needing help is normal! Needing to always be the guy in charge? That's called dysfunction. 

[[LEAVE EDWIN]] | [[BRING EDWIN]]

:: LEAVE EDWIN

Edwin ends up convincing ATOC that they need to destroy the entire thing. Tear it down before it ends the entire earth or whatever. 

This version - MID POINT - FALSE DEFEAT. it's him who's saved by Malachi. 

He failed. 

Now, the only way to save him is to stop him. 

BAD GUYS CLOSE IN: 

He goes to ANNA. 




:: BRING EDWIN
