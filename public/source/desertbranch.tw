:: PACK MINIMAL 
Zayne looks at the mess in his closet. All the unused camping gear and fishing poles--things he's never had time to use anyway. 

He grabs a pair of jeans, a toothbrush, logging boots, pulls on his tattered $shirt shirt. <<audio ":playing" fadeout>>

ZAYNE
Still fits!

It really doesn't. 

HARPER
That's all you're bringing...

ZAYNE
Keep it simple. Less things to go wrong. 

HARPER
I'm not sure that applies to //preparation//...

Z grabs his lunch box.

ZAYNE
Ford, let's go!

EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - NEARBY

A LINE OF ARMORED SUVS hurtles down the iced over gravel road. An ARMORED CARRIER rides at the center. 

INT. ARMORED CARRIER

The carrier is dark, the only illumination coming from the plexiglass HATCH overhead. In the shadows of the carrier, something BREATHES. A man. Two men? A beast? Something huge and heavy, something //merged.//

EXT. GRAVEL ROAD

The vehicles churn around a SNOWY CORNER, approaching (a half mile away) ZAYNE'S TRAILER.

EXT. HOUSE 

Zayne hustles the kids toward the a lifted PINTO that he somehow fit a 1980s Big Cam Cummins into (with the help of a hand-torched hole in the hood). 33s and snow chains. It's like something out of Mad Max if the post apocalyptic future had amateur welders. 

HARPER
Do you speak //any// Spanish? Have you ever even left Montana?

ZAYNE
Donday es-ta el ba-no. Yo soy mu-ee guapo. And yes, actually. Senior trip, 98. Broke down in Cour'd'Alene, thank you very much. 
(then)
Family's family. And if my idiot brother needs help, I'm the idiot that's gonna help him, every damn time. 

INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Z turns the ignition. <<audio ":all" pause>> 

As he PEELS out--

INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The PHONE RINGS, un-answered. We'll never know what that was. 

THROUGH THE BEDROOM WINDOW - THE PHALANX of black SUVS approach

INT. PINTO - MOMENTS LATER

Zayne drives, jaw clenched. Working over his brother's bullshit in his mind. 

Harper watches him, not sure how to break through his anger. 

HARPER
Well, at least it's warm in Peru. That'll be a nice break. 

ZAYNE
Hot I bet. Hot and humid... mosquitos and spiders and diarrhea water.
(then sotto)
Like he's //allergic// to responsibility I swear to--

Z hits the accelerator.

HARPER
Father... I get that you are annoyed... but can we maybe not drive--

He SKIDS around an icy corner, back tire chains SLAPPING the rusty undercarriage. Harper grabs the //oh shit// bar. It falls off in her hand. 

HARPER
//Quite...// so stupidly?

Ford leans forward, big grin. 

FORD
Floor it, floor it, floor it!

[[DRIVE CAREFUL]]

[[FLOOR IT]]

:: DRIVE CAREFUL [death] 
Zayne looks over at HARPER and laughs. She crosses her arms at him, faux annoyed. <<set $deaths to $deaths + 1>>

HE SLAMS on the brakes, skidding to a CRAWL. He leans over the wheel like a grandma. 

ZAYNE
(old lady voice)
Does this make you feel more comfortable? I'd hate for you to be uncomfortable... 

Ford cracks up. Harper laughs too, but then, she sees something in the rear-view mirror: in the far distance, a line of CARS approaches.

ZAYNE
(old lady voice)
Do you want me to get you a //diaper// just in case? I always bring some in me bonnet...

HARPER
Funny. 
(looking back at the cars)
Dad do you see those care? They're driving really, really fast....

ZAYNE 
(old lady voice)
Well that's no good... me personally... I won't want to take any //risks//, it might scare my //daughter.// That's why I never drive too fa--

But the cars come around the corner now. POPPING SOUNDS. 

HARPER
No, seriously DAD!

Now BULLETS hit the glass. 

Zayne swivels. The car SKIDS. Hits tries to correct...

But it's too late

SLOW MOTION: THEY SCREAM...

As an RPG spirals out of the SUV.

As it EXPLODES, text on screen:

Maybe not the best time to make fun of your daughter. Next time [[Drive Faster->FLOOR IT]]

At the last minute, Z swerves onto a barely-visible SHORT CUT. As the little car with huge tires SLALOMS through the snow, they're almost completely blinding them. It's insane, they're all laughing now. 

But through the back window, Ford sees something big approaching. 

The black SUVS are trying to catch up. 

A MAN LEANS OUT A WINDOW, tries to fire his gun, but ZAYNE, just showing off for his kids, CORNERs again, SPRAYING SNOW. 

INT. PINTO 

Blissfully unaware he's almost being murdered, Z whoops like an idiot, sliding down an impossible steep hill. Trees WHIP by the window. The kids are AIRBORNE in their seats. 

FORD
OH MY GOD THIS IS REALLY CRAZY!

One of the SUVs (far behind them now) SMASHES into a tree, EXPLODING (very James Bond winter chase scene here) but the one behind makes it.

A man leans out the window with a ROCKET LAUNCHER, trying to get an BEAD on the car. 

THROUGH THE GUN'S SITE, the Pinto approaches the hwy.

EXT. HWY - MOMENTS LATER

Z sits at the entrance to the hwy. The exact opposite of their wild four-wheeling moments ago. Now, it's quiet in the car, just the tick tick tick of the turn signal.

He looks left. Looks right. Looks left again. 

The music is so loud, they don't see the vehicle rolling down the hill behind them, end over end.

As it crunches to a stop, a HORRIBLY HUGE MAN tears his way out of the wreckage. Despite a missing leg, he runs on all fours like a dog, approaching quickly. 

[[JUST GO]]
[[WAIT FOR A GAP]]

ZAYNE
Every damn time. You can't get a gap. 

The truck blows past. Maybe a HALF MILE away, another car approaches. 

ZAYNE
See? It's like they //planned it//. Can't get... a <<linkappend "gap.">><<include "TRUCK GAP">><</linkappend>>

They get DESTROYED by the trucks.

A line of trucks comes through.

Well, you get what you pay for--listen, you think she's ok with me dropping the kids off a little early? Something... came up... and uh... I'm going to PERU. 

ext. tammy's gun range. 

Ext. TAMMY'S HOUSE DAY

Zayne drops off the kid at TAMMY's GUN RANGE. 

Zayne flirts with the ladies a bit, but Tammy gives him shit. It's clear they're good friends. He tells her he's off to see save 

TAMMY
That in Mexico?

ZAYNE
See that's what I thought? But apparently, no. Southern America.

Tammy shrugs: //huh.// Behind them, Nancy (tiny, late 50s) UNLOADS A CLIP into a target with her ex-husband's (asshole) face on it. 

NANCY
I AM NOT AFRAID OF YOU SPENCER!

TAMMY
That's right Nancy! You tell em!
(then to Z, teary)
Gal-//dang//, I'm proud of that gal. Know what she named her 12 guage?
(beat)
Restraining order. Hah! Can't make this shit up...

She laughs, slapping her chewing tobacco. 

TAMMY
Chaw?

ZAYNE
On the wagon... 

TAMMY
(like he's an idiot)
Suit yourself. 

Take care of my kids and ex-wife, Tammy. I'm off to drain my kids college funds on my stupidass brother again. 

Tammy laughs, too hard. 

TAMMY
Your kids ain't got no college fund, Z! Gah-lee! That's good. 

ZAYNE looks at the storm. 

Tammy says he should stay. 

ZAYNE
Gotta get to Malachi. Fore he digs himself an even more expensive hole. 

They wave goodbye to him just as the STORM HITS. 

A HELICOPTER trying to follow him gets lost in the storm.

INT. BOZEMAN AIRPORT - NIGHT

There's a WOMAN following him - ANNA. Maybe she kills one of the men following him. He keeps being saved by her and has no idea how. 

Does she have some kind of weapon capable of taking them out?

As he makes it through the detectors. 

It's funny if he's close to being killed but your choices are for very inane things.

Z is FOLLOWED into the airport, but he's too distracted by the ESCALATOR to notice someone get ARRESTED behind him. 

Maybe he goes up to the front desk - I'd like to buy a flight for Peru. 

You don't have a ticket?

Nope. 

The creature following him DROPS. We don't see how. 

INT. AIRPORT - KIOSK

He browses sandwiches, is shocked by the prices. The woman behind the counter looks at him.

CANDACE
Where you headed, honey?

Z isn't sure if he should answer. 

ZAYNE
Long ways from here. 

CANDACE
As in... overseas?

Z has to think a long time.

ZAYNE
I'm not sure... technically. 

She shakes her head. 

CANDACE
And you didn't bring pack your own snacks?

She tsk under her breath, motions him closer. 

CANDACE
Lemme tell you somethin... //overseas? //

They eat //snails.// They make cheese out of //heads.// They put blood? In their goddamn //oatmeal.//

Zayne tries to walk into the airport, followed close behind by a CRAZED LOOKING, HEAVILY BREATHING MAN. He's about to get nabbed by them when he sets off the METAL DETECTORS. 

A woman bumps into you.

He's pulled into a BACK ROOM, doesn't even notice as the man who was following him is TACKLED by security. 

INT. SECURITY OFFICE 

Z get SCANNED in a back room. He has knives, fireworks, chainsaw fuel in his bag. It's a mess.

He walks, a little crooked, toward his gate. 

The gate agent tells him he's just in time. He says he got searched. She smiles.

Then, an announcement for his flight. 

Z RUNS through the airport. 

A WOMAN in BLACK follows him. The flight's almost closed. 

He gets on the flight, then realizes something. He gets off for some reason. He knows the pilot. 

Maybe a NEEDLE is waiting for him in his seat. but he never sits down on it. Maybe somebody else does - a guy who's an asshole, passes out. 

Gets drunk with one of the crew. 

INT. PLANE - OVER THE OCEAN 

On the flight, she gives him a DRINK TICKET. 

Maybe he sleeps in the secret bunks over the cab.   

He passes out, misses a FIGHT on the plane. The man is restrained.

Z stretches casually, climbs down from his flight cabin.

MAN

Zayne smiles, big. 

ZAYNE
Yeah, hey, I need a little help. I need a truck, a map... probably some sort of weapons... you know of any saw shops...

But then, another man RUNS up. 

OTHER MAN

In the back of hte truck, Zayne sits BLINDFOLDED, gaurded by two heavily armed guerilla TEENAGERS: JESUS and OMAR. They rifle through his bags. <<if $saveanna is "0">><<include "WHAT HAPPENED">><</if>>

OMAR (SPANISH)
I mean, I know Americans are stupid but this pundejo just //came.// On his own! We didn't even have to go get him.

As they laugh, Zayne doesn't have to speak Spanish to know he's pretty much fucked. 

Ext. ancient desert temple site - later

As the truck pulls into a REMOTE DESERT TEMPLE SITE (think Chan Chan but less excavated), Zayne is drug from the truck and drug to someone's feet. 

He looks up to see ATOC. 

Zayne demands to see his brother, to know that he's safe, but ATOC just smiles. 

ATOC (IN SPANISH)
So your Malachi sends for his brother. As like... a back up plan? And so I'm thinking. Holy shit, his brother, he must be this badass, maybe military, maybe cop? But damn. Look at this. 

His men laugh. 

ATOC (IN SPANISH)
Some washed up redneck? Damn.

Do you understand that you are stupid? Do you understand that?

Zayne rubs his head.
