''Oh hey.''

''Welcome to "This Is How Z Dies." '' (if you've already been here you can [[SKIP INTRO|OPENING PERU][$totalLines to 0]])

It's an interactive script for an interactive film...

But it's not quite a script yet. 

It's an outline, but bigger. A //scriptment.// But funner. With music sometimes.

Our goals with this are pretty simple: we're making an interactive narrative film that's actually fun to play. And also, replay. And also makes you feel something at the end. 

As you'll see, there are a lot of choices, the choices come quick and the choices actually matter. 

Your decisions will drive the story, introducing you to entirely unique storylines, characters, set pieces, environments, song choices, even wardrobe decisions. 

Along the way--as the title suggests--you will also make Zayne die a lot. <<linkappend "''BUT!''">><<update>><<include "INTRO 2">> <</linkappend>> 
::INTRO 2 [fake]
1) We learn from our mistakes! Also:

2) Those deaths trigger some of the best sequences of the film. There are 25 'secret ending' //short films// that players can collect, rewatch and share. 

Depending on choices, each 'playthrough' has a ''runtime of 90 to 110 minutes.'' In that time, you will only experience about 1/5 of the total scenes. So it's worth going back replaying, seeing the worlds you missed first time through. 

It's a miniseries amount of content, but laid out like a playground, not a track. And like a miniseries, deeper engagement leads to deeper emotional investment and connection to the characters. Inside jokes, eastereggs, hidden scenes, fan theories, etc. It's gonna be fun. 

BUT, if all that sounds complicated, it's simple to play. A choice looks like this:

[[I FEELIN' PRETTY CONFIDENT|CHOICE INTRO][$introchoice to 0; $deaths to $deaths + 1]]

[[Y'KNOW WHAT? I'M STILL LEARNING.|CHOICE INTRO][$introchoice to 1]]

::CHOICE INTRO [fake]
<<nobr>><<if $introchoice is 1>><<include "CHOICE 2">><<else>><<include "CHOICE 1">><</if>><</nobr>>These achievements, along with death counts and other statistics will be compiled for players at the end of the film. Maybe even cut into a fancy little 'achievements' trailer they can share on social. Think: 

//Holy shit, my highschool boyfriend got to be best friends with an incredibly cute monkey and I didn't!? I better go replay this movie and share the results with all my friends!!//

@@And then, we could even mint custom NFTs for each...@@ 

Nope. Nope. Not NFTS. There are limits. 

Anyway, That's it. That's how you progress. 

Note: use the in-built "BACK" and "FORWARD" to navigate in the story if you want to back up and take a different path (this won't be an option for players). And "RESTART" will clear all your game data to give you a fresh start. 

To see ALL passages in a searchable and printable form (I don't know why you would give notes on something that's already perfect, but you do you), click HERE. To see a story map click here. 

Final notes:

- The first act is more fleshed-out, just to get a sense of pacing and tone, and it get progressively more outline-y from there. 

-This looks like garbage on mobile, so use your laptop or PC. Chrome, Safari, or Firefox, all those are good. No internet explorer.

Ok, stop asking questions! 

Let's [[START|OPENING PERU][$deaths to 0; $totalLines to 0]]!

::CHOICE 2 [fake]
Wow, you survived your first choice!

Had you clicked "I GET IT" you would have died! As a reward, you even picked up a fancy  'Genius' achievement (see below). <<pickup '$inventory' 'Truly a Genius'>>

::CHOICE 1 [fake]
Oh nooooo!

You made the wrong choice and you died! 

It's almost like you were a little overconfident, even after we warned you! Scroll down to the footer to find the death count below (don't worry, we'll reset your deaths once you start playing), and you'll see we've also given your first //"achievement".// If you want to call it that. <<pickup '$inventory' 'Arrogant Bastard'>>

EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

Gina stands in front of the airplane being wheeled in. They finally upgrading the planes? 

New guy on the crew too, a 

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

Idea - start on the inside - just the the eyes. 

Idea - the bear is FULL of stuff. It's like his suit case. Ketchup, a couple Rainier lites, his pocket knife, snacks, a pee bottle, all his clothes. He's pretty set. 

Maybe the workers remark that the bear smells like corn nuts and chewing tobacco. 

WORKER
Smells like Montana... 

WORKERS wheel a heavy TAXIDERMY GRIZZLY BEAR into the cargo hold. 

They set it amidst a herd of bubble wrapped Elk, tape it down, sweating as the PILOT, (ROBBY, 60s, Boston) and his COPILOT/FIRST OFFICER (GINA, 30s, Cuban) look over the bear. 

EDUARDO
This bear smells like corn nuts to you? Smells like my exwife's minivan. 

Gina walks over, leans in, sniffs hard. 

GINA
Smells like my friggen stepson. 

INSIDE THE BEAR - Z sweats, barely breathing. As they walk away, he sniffs himself. Damn. It's rough. 

Eduardo approaches closer, eyeing the STITCHING on the side of the grizzly. Z is sure he's about to get caught but then their LOADMASTER, PEDRO (25) guides a LARGE crate into the bay behind them. 

PEDRO
You think that's weird? Look at this shit.

He wheels the crate next to the grizzly bear, pulls back the tarp. Inside, a HABITAT crate with an incredibly cute EMPEROR TAMARIN (imagine the cutest, squirrel sized monkey with an unbelievably large Lorax mustache... or [[Don't Imagine|http://www.tinyurl.com/2p8w5v6c]]). This is CECILIA. 

As Pedro puts his hand into the cage, Cecilia tries to BITE him. 

ANNA enters behind (35, peruvian accent, dressed as animal trainer but carries herself like a cop). She says Cecilia isn't tame. She's being returned to the jungle as part of a smuggled animal return program. 

PEDRO
I like her. She's seen some shit. I connect with that, yo. You bite all you want baby girl. You bite all you want. 

Gina rolls her eyes. 

GINA
Jesus fuggin God.  Ain't this special... grizzly bear and a mustache rat. That thing gets out of its cage, it's gonna be stuffed too. I swear to God.
(then)
Robby, let's go!

Robby's still looking at the Grizzly. Z sweats inside. As Robby pulls away, Z sighs with relief. 

CUT TO:

The cargo plane cuts through the sky. 

But above and behind it... an all-black HIGH ALTITUDE ALL BLACK AIR CRAFT EMERGES FROM THE CLOUDS.

People put on masks and parachutes. Preparing to jump. 

Int. cargo plane. 

IN THE BEAR SUIT, Z reaches into his tight wranglers, pulls out a BEEF JERKY CHEW CAN (trying to quit chaw) and a bag of corn nuts. 

In the cage next to him, Shirley looks up at him, sniffing. 

He freezes. 

She growls. 

ZAYNE
(whisper)
Nice monkey. Nice monkey. Please be quiet. Please. 

She growls LOUDER. Anna, sleeping next to her, almost wakes up. 

ZAYNE
Are you allowed to have corn nuts? What are corn nuts even made of? 

Shirley narrows her eyes, climbs closer. 

ZAYNE I want to give them to you. I do. But if you die... 

Shirley gives him the cutest face in the world. 

[[GIVE SHIRLEY CORN NUTS][$shirleyrelat to "love"]]
[[DON'T GIVE MONKEYS CORN NUTS]]

:: JUMP 
Zayne takes Anna and the monkey.  but at the last moment, the monkey JUMPS to PEDRO. 

They both JUMP

Pedro gets 
Romance starting with sharks in the water. 

Zayne and Anna crash land (or parachute depending on story choices) into the OCEAN (or mountains, I'll stop) off the coast of Peru. Sharks in the water. We quickly establish a mutual dislike between them. 

She hates Americans, she loves trees. Zayne has a Montana-shaped tree stump tattooed on his chest. But, to survive, they have to build a raft out of debris and fight off sharks and she sees his muscles a lot, and this only makes her hate him more. Romancing the Stone shit.

On shore, Zayne tells Anna about his mission to save his brother. This scene takes place in a rural seaside market. There's only fish, and Z doesn't eat sea food. He keeps asking for hamburgers, no cheese, no pickles, just ketchup.

We set up that the last record of the THE TANGLED PRAYER is from a poem fragment by JUAN DE GUELPE a 15th century monk at a monastary built on top of (desecrating) an ancient Norte Chico temple site. 

That mission became a mansion. And now it's the biggest history museum in Peru. Zayne says he's going there to find the artifact. Anna points out the that he doesn't know anyone, doesn't speak the language, he's kind of dumb and very much going to die, but this doesn't stop him.

[[MUSEUM HEIST]]

:: LEAVE ANNA 
Zayne tells Anna he has to leave if he's going to get them help. He can barely make it himself in drifts this deep, if took her, they would all die. 

She gives him her global satellite phone, she hasn't been able to get signal, but maybe he will along the way

He wraps himself in the bearskin for warmth. He piles the rest of the skins onto Anna and Shirley for warmth.

That night, Zayne sneaks out. 

It's brutal. The moonlight makes it so he can just BARELY see. 

He checks the phone... no signal. 

FAR BELOW HIM, He sees a stone cairn catch the last of the suns rays ahead of him. It's across a massive ravine and the sun is setting fast. 

It might offer shelter, but also, it's so far... 

[[MAKE FOR THE CAIRN]]

[[DON'T RISK IT->UNSURE ANDES SHELTER]]



:: TAKE ANNA WITH YOU {"position":"1925,750"}
That night, Zayne wraps himself and Anna in bear skin and elk hide, sneaks out of the cave shelter. 

Out in the howling dark of high-elevation Andes, you heft Anna onto your back. Shirley watches. 130 lbs is heavier than you thought it would be. 

ANNA
Are you sure I'm not too heavy?

ZAYNE
Course. 

Shirley burrows into Zayne's neck, shivering. 

As Anna climbs on his back, Zayne braces himself. 

ZAYNE
Welp... here we go. 

He takes a step. Shit. 130 lbs is heavier than he thought. 

ANNA
You sure you're ok?

ZAYNE
Oh yeah, all good. It's not heavy it's just... an awkward size. 

ANNA
I'm an awkard size?

ZAYNE
No no, just need to get the weight... the small weight... off my shoulders and onto my... hips. 

He takes another step, tries to adjust the Anna's position and SLIPS.... falling off the ridge down into a crevasse. 

Their screams echo in the darkness.

:: ENTER ICE SHELTER 
Zayne survives the night in the cave...when he wakes up he sees in the morning light, an incredibly well preserved mummy: the Maiden of Llullailaco - holding the Tangled Prayer and wearing a gold-plated mask with a map of constellations on it. 

This is an incredibly valuable find.

ext. glacier - night

Zayne takes the easier path down the mountain. <<set $meettammy to 0>><<set $scareloc1 to "on the side of a mountain">>

But as he goes on, the sun sets and temperature drops. 

The wind cuts through his bear skins and his face is numbing. 

For the first time Zayne realizes he's in trouble and he doens't know what to do.

He crouches in the lee of a rock ledge and feels a strange warmth begin to suffuse him. It feels so nice to rest. 

He wakes himself. This is bad, this is very, very bad. He pulls out Anna's phone.

[[CALL HARPER]]

[[CALL 911->DON'T CALL HARPER]]

:: CALL HARPER 
Zayne lifts his phone, dials his daughters number by heart. <<include "HARPER I'M SCARED">>

Call Harper. Tell her you're on a glacier and you're just going to take a little nap. 

Harper starts shouting at you to stay awake. Is there shelter somewhere? 

[[ENTER ICE SHELTER]]

:: DON'T CALL HARPER 
Zayne dials 911. <<pickup '$inventory' 'Made a Monster'>><<set $deaths to $deaths + 1>>

He waits, shivering as it rings. 

The operator answers, in Spanish. (Note, dialing 911 in any nation now redirects you to the appropriate PSAP! Progress!)

ZAYNE
Hello? I'm sorry, I don't speak spanish... I'm on a mountain... I'm very cold?

OPERATOR
Hablas EspaÃ±ol? 

ZAYNE
It's a very big mountain. I'm very very cold. 

The opererator tries, but this is hopeless. 

The phone dies. 

Zayne sinks into the drift. 

It's getting really, really warm. The glacier isn't so bad. It's kind of nice how dark it is, actually. Slow, Zayne closes his <<linkappend "eyes.">><<include "DEATH OF THE AMAZON">><</linkappend>>



:: VARIOUS SURVIVAL {"position":"1525,2250"}
Tension comes from between Anna and Zayne

Other crew member who actually works for Atoc-tries to sabotage them. 

Trying to care for the Ape, but the Ape drives them together. 

It's like a strange baby. 

If he finds the thing. 

Bad guy launches an avalanche. 

Who do you trust. 

Alliances. 
His lie is that sacrifice is the only right path. 

Why was he there. 

Protects his brother to a fault. 

If he tells his Anna the truth it launches a new storyline where he is trying to convince his brother to do the right thing. 

Anna's trying to find Malachi. Selling shit on the black market. "He's a bad guy, some things are bigger than family."

Zayne can't accept that. 

Zayne: you're wrong. That's true for some people, but not for me. 

But he can still help her. I'm not gonna betray my brother, but I trust you more than I trust him.. once we're out of here, it's may the best man win. 

Or he can trust the other guy. His name is worm worm. 

He can choose to give the bad guy THE TANGLED PRAYER or keep it a secret. 

He can show anna the Tangled prayer or keep it a secret. 

If he doesn't trust her/trusts the other guy, he and the monkey have to make it to "save Malachi" alone in the mountains and jungle. 

And then this will fall apart in some way. 

If he doesn't trust anyone, 

If he trusts Anna -- he talks to his daughter. Maybe Anna has the global satellite phone. 

Harper says she knows what the code means. 

He and Anna go to the place...

But it's the wrong place. 

and MIDPOINT he finds out that his brother didn't want to be rescued. 

He trusts the bad guy. And the bad guy takes the quipu to his brother. 

And Anna is hurt really badly. Anna has to drink the water. 

She becomes the immortal. 

The only way to save the world is to become immortal himself. 

Anna has Edwin's unpublished document. 

He's been destroying sites and sellling things to Atoc/Malachi. It's a smuggling ring she thinks. 



The bad guy sees it. 

And that's why they stay alive. 

:: MID POINT 
Get what you think you want. 

And it goes horrible wrong. 

After museum, you get to brother and it backfires. 

You get to star map location and it's not right. 

Is there a version where you choose Anna instead. 

Zayne sacrifices himself for Anna and it goes horribly wrong. 

And he still doubles down. 

The Immortal make him a trap for his brother. 

He has a chance to escape and save them both but doesn't take it - family is more important than everything. 

Daughter tells him how much it will cost her if he doesn't make it. 

She wants him to come home. 

Bring him to verge of right choice and then get interrupted.

Hola muchacho, tengoâ€¦unaâ€¦natty lite?]

The bartender stares at Z uncomprehendingly. Just as he's about to try again, but louder, there's a voice at his elbow. 

SECURITY
Are you supposed to be here, sir?]

The next thing Z knows, he's outside the servers entrance, two men in white waiter jackets smoke a cigarette beside him. 

ZAYNE
Which way to town?]

The man grunts and points down a trail. Zayne sets off.

Just then, it starts to rain. Behind him there's laughter, and the last words he hears from a human before he succumbs to hypothermia 15 miles deep in the jungle are in a language he doesn't understand. 


:: ORDER MARTINI 
ZAYNE
Une martini, por favor.

The bartender responds with a string of questions in spanish Z can't even begin to translate. 

ZAYNE
Uh. Yes.

A dirty AF martini is set down in front of him. He takes a sip and spits it out. 

ZAYNE
Holy shit that's disgustingâ€“

Beside him, a security guard appears. 

SECURITY

I think the soft drinks are at the kid's bar.

Z turns to see a PHILANTHROPIST is eyeing him. 

Z
Oh, great. Thank you, ma'am.

Z moves to leave, but the Philanthropist catches his arm. 

PHILANTHROPIST
I'm joking. What's a thicc American like you doing at a boring affair like this?

ZAYNE
(nervous)
I'm a philanthropist.

PHILANTHROPIST
Oh? What a coincidence. What's your foundation?

ZAYNE
Bill Gates. Oooh one sec, fella--

A server passes. Z grabs a cracker, tries to take a bite. Almost throws up. 

ZAYNE
What the hell is on that??

ZAYNE spits. 

PHILANTHROPIST 
Peruvian builder ants. Baked, I believe. I didn't realize the Gates' were interested in  Moche pottery. How charming.

ANNA
(O.S.)
Once you get used to the accent the charm lessens considerably.

Anna sweeps into frame, cleaned up and looking stunning. 

ANNA
Hi, Honey. I've been looking all over for you.

ZAYNE
You have?

She smiles and kisses his cheek. 

(set: $ROMANCE to 1)

ZAYNE

What are you doing?

ANNA
We've got a map to steal.

ZAYNE
You said I was stupid. And that I was gonna die.

ANNA
Without my help. Let's go.

ZAYNE
Can we eat first? Not ants?

Over his shoulder, Anna sees two IMMORTALS in ill fitting tuxes who look almost as out of place as Z. 

ANNA
No.

They head across the banquet hall. A security guard, looking bored, mans a velvet rope blocking their way. 

Choose where to begin the search:

SECURITY

ZAYNE

Zayne ducks and tries to execute a spin kick...but he misses the security guard's legs, and topples sideways...feeling something slip in his lower back. 

He tries to get up but he can't...

He's slipped a disk. 

10 YEARS LATER

Zayne, 200 lbs heavier, pushes his electric wheel chair to the max as he rockets down a Wal-Mart aisle towards the chips. Since he slipped a disk, he lost his company, and his only joy now comes from salted and deep fried foods he can barely afford on Disability. 



:: GO QUIETLY 
The next thing Z knows, he's outside the servers entrance, two men in white waiter jackets smoke a cigarette beside him watching idly as security dusts off their jackets and heads back inside. 

ZAYNE
Which way to town?

The man grunts and points down a trail. Z sets off.

SECURITY GUARD
Hey. Hey. //HEY!//

[[RUN PAST SECURITY GUARD]]



:: RUN PAST SECURITY GUARD 
Z and Anna break into a sprint. An Alarm goes off as they run down the hallway into the main exhibit of the museum, guard in pursuit. 

There's three doors in front of them: one is filled with glass shelves holding pottery, the second is dim, but whistling sound comes from the doorway, and the third doorway has a ancient Moche warrior mask hanging over it. 

Choose where to hide: 

[[CHOOSE POTTERY ROOM->POTTERY]]

[[CHOOSE MUSIC AND WEAPONS ROOM->MUSIC]] 

[[CHOOSE THE WARRIOR ROOM->WARRIOR]]

:: POTTERY 
They run into the glass shelved pottery room displaying thousands of ancient Mochico fertility pottery. They duck quickloy beind a helf and Z looks back through the gap in the pottery to see if they were followed. We hear the security guard enter. 

From his POV, we slowly focus on the pottery he's inadventerantly placed his hand onâ€¦and realize it's a giant dick impregnating the world. Basically. 

ZAYNE
What the fuck!

The security guard hears and moves towards them. There's some cat and mouse amid the ferticility pottery that ends with Z crashing into one of the shelves and bringing an end to the pursuit in a rain of erotic pottery.

Someone's going to Peruvian jail for a long, long time. Better luck next time!




:: MUSIC 
Inside the music room, there's hollow gourds lined up in front of a giant wind tunnel covered with a grate. The wind blowing through the gourds makes a high whistling sound that's quite beautiful and oddly hypnotic. They're shaken out of it by footsteps behind them. 

ANNA
Shit! It's locked. 

Z looks at it closely. He runs his finger along the edges of the grate. With click, he opens it. 

ANNA
How did you do that?

Z shrugs. 

ZAYNE
I know how things work. 

ANNA
Wow, you go from helpless to smug really quickly. 

(set: $romance to 2)

Behind them, two IMMORTALS dash into the room. 

Z and Anna dash into the tunnel, having no idea where they'll end up, Z closing the grate behind them. The immortals start throwing their bodies at the cover of the grate. It's not gonna hold. 

[[GO THROUGH THE WIND TUNNEL->WIND TUNNEL]]

[[PANIC]]


:: WARRIOR {"position":"825,1625"}
Z and Anna skitter into a room holding fifty or so arrangements of Ceremonial Moche warriors armor. From the walls scour the face of the Fanged God. 

Only a few moments later, Security guards enter. 

There's a tense moment as they search the roomâ€¦and we notice that, in two of the suits of armorâ€¦there's eyes moving. 

The security leaves, but as they do, they leave one guard outside the door. 

Z and Anna are stuck. They whisper frantically. 

ZAYNE
Should we make a break for it?

ANNA
And go where, exactly?

ZAYNE
I dunno. But we can't leave without finding the Tangled Prayer. And my brother. And some //food.//

ANNA
Look. A server left some hors d'oeuvres. 

ZAYNE
What the hell are they?

ANNA

Z sniffs the plate.

ZAYNE
Holy shit. It'sâ€¦good.




:: WIND TUNNEL {"position":"600,1275"}
They grope their way through the dark tunnel. Up ahead, there's a light. 

Behind them, the grate breaks with a wrenching sound. 

They runâ€¦only to reach the end of the tunnel and realize they're only exit is on the side of a building. They can face the immortals, or jump. 

[[JUMP OFF THE EDGE]]

[[FACE THEM]]

:: FACE THEM 
ANNA
Fuck this. 

Anna pulls a pistol from somewhere in her dress. 

ZAYNE
Uh...

The first Immortal is through the grate. 

Anna empties her 12 round clip into his brain. 

He falls. 

But his body keeps moving forward.

ANNA
Jesus...Christ...

The second of the Immortals climbs through the grate and runs at Z, in a dead sprint. 

Z sidesteps and the immortal goes flying off the edge of the building. 

The third reaches them. Z panicks and swings, hitting him right in the solar plexus. The immortal looks shocked. He gasps for air. Anna slips her leg behind his and pushes...he trips and falls backwards in front of the ledge. 

They're not robots, after all. 

ZAYNE
Tell me where my brother is. Malachi.

IMMORTAL
(struggling for breath)
...who...

ANNA
The Tangled Prayer, then. Is it in this building?

IMMORTAL
It's.... every...where.

He staggers to his feet. Z and Anna tense themselves. 

The Immortal smiles, and takes a step backward into thin air. 

ZAYNE
Where did you learn to shoot like that? And where did you get that gun?

ANNA
We don't have time for exposition, okay?

ZAYNE 
For what?


:: JUMP OFF THE EDGE 
ZAYNE gulps, looking into the darkness below. From behind, the two immortals rush. 

He jumps. 

He shouldn't have. There's a bamboo forest beneath him, and those bamboo trees act a lot like spears from that height. 

Next time, don't jump off a building like you're in some stupid action movie. 


:: PANIC 
The banging grows louder. The Immortals aren't smart, but they don't seem to care about the physical destruction they're doing to their bodies: one, banging on the grate, breaks his arm, a glint of bone showing through, but doesn't stop, beating his own hands in bloody stumps against the metal. 

ZAYNE
Oh shit ohshitohshit...

ANNA
Hold on, we have to--somebody--my hands are--

Z
They're so scary, so so so--

ANNA
It's okay--it'll be--it'll be--

ZAYNE
My kids. Harper. Ford. Oh my god...

ANNA
It's okay, here...here...I'm here...

The grate shudders. 

Anna and Z cling together. 

<<set $romance to 10>>

The grate bends. The wind howls louder in the tunnel. It grows and grows until it's impossibly to think or hear anything else. 

The grate brakes. 

//Sorry, people. Panic attacks aren't really evolutionarily beneficial, unless you're trying to get out of going to the mall with your girlfriend, so try to bring some Xanax next time.// 


:: GO THROUGH HER BAGS 
Zayne looks through her bags, finds out that Anna is a member of the PERUVIAN FBI. She was trying to arrest him. <<set $alptrust to "Pedro">>

HIs heart sinks.

Pedro looks over at him. 

PEDRO
See, I told you dude. She's shady as fuck.

Gina looks pissed. 

He lifts a can of pickles from the boxes. 

PEDRO
Dude, we got kimchi, we got //siracha,// we got HELLA pickles!

:: TALK TO ANNA 1 ON 1 {"position":"1475,1500"}
Zayne gets a moment alone with Anna.<<set $saveshirley to 1>> 

He asks her directly what's happening. Who is she? Why does she have a gun?

She comes clean. She's trying to stop Malachi. She wanted him to lead her to him. She tells him his brother is working with a smuggler. She says she wasn't going to hurt him, or Zayne, but she was hoping she could convince him to help her find him. 

ANNA
Z... your brother... I don't know his story, but he's working with very bad men. They're sellling our culture out from under us, they're stealing our history. Z, I know you love your brother... but he's on the wrong side of this.

Zayne says that sounds about right. But he tells her his loyalty to his brother is unrelenting. 

ANNA
Some things are bigger than family. 

Zayne stiffens. 

ZAYNE
That might be true for some people... but not for me. 

Anna looks down. This is a dead end streat. But then, Zayne looks at her. 

ZAYNE
Look, I'm not gonna betray my brother. That's just... case closed, ok?

ANNA
(sensing an opening)
Ok...

ZAYNE
But he's... well let's just say he's had a complicated relationship with the truth his whole life. I know that. I'll help you get out of here. I'll do what I can to make sure you're ok. But once we're out of this shit? End of the day, he's still my brother. You still try to arrest him...

ANNA
I will. 

ZAYNE
Well, if you do... It's gonna be every man for himself. 

ANNA
Ok. I respect that. Thank you. But we cannot trust that man. If we're going to survive, you have to go get help. Tonight.

I can't leave you here.

Zayne manages to CRASH LAND in a glacier. It's crazy and terrifying. 

Zayne is THROWN from the plane, lands in a snow drift.

Zayne crawls out of the snow. 

On the glacier below, the belly of the plane smolders.

ANNA
I take animal safety really seriously.

PEDRO
Sorry for trying to help. But you're a big American man, right? You don't need any help. Let's see how that plays out. 

Zayne ignores him. Gina smiles at him. He's definitely gained her trust. He starts opening boxes, realizes the only food they have is pickles, siracha and kimchi. <<set $alptrust to "Gina">>

ZAYNE
Goddamn.

The world starts to dim. His thumb's going numb with pain.

There's no time to make a big enough shelter now 

Cut to:

This scene sets up the heart of this storyline. It's survivor -- all about alliances and trust. Who's lying to you, who do you lie to?

Zayne and Gina help Anna (barely conscious) and Pedro (broken arm and ribs but talking) into the $shelter.  

As Gina starts a FIRE, Zayne looks at the GUN strapped to Anna's waist

Pedro notices you notice.

He points to a BLACK BAG behind the pilot seat. 

PEDRO
You see that too? She's not a pilot, cabron. She's //la placa.// I swear to God. Look in her bag. 

Gina tells you that's fucked up. I don't like monkey lady either but she's hurt. 

Pedro says we gotta see what she has, what if she has matches, or power bars and shit. That's just survival.

:: NEXT MORNING 
Shirley crawls out of the snow, wipes the snow from Zayne's frozen face. 

Possible ending - she takes the bag of corn nuts from his pocket. 

She returns to the jungle.

Cut to: thousands of years later,

a MUCH BIGGER version of mustached monkeys chisel the word CORN NUTS into stone. 

Maybe they've forsaken fire as a species, they instead make more an more elaborate [[SHELTERS->Make a Shelter]]

ZAYNE
Ok, ok, hold on. 

Zayne pushes corn nuts out of the bears mouth, Shirley gobbles them up, seems not to die. <<set $shirleytrust to $shirleytrust + 1>>

Immediately, she looks back at him, demanding more. 

Just then:

EXPAND

The plane is attacked mid-flight by The Immortal, who board mid flight (think Dark Knight Rises opening scene). Zayne has to fight get out of the bear and fight for his life.  

Z is strong, but not exactly a great fighter. We meet their LEADER - a masked woman named YARA. 

In the fight he grabs her arm, rubbing away a DUST COVERING that reveals a TATTOO: an ancient God. This is THE FANGED DEITY. The same face that Malachi saw in the jungle. 

She didn't want him to see this.

He's getting his ass kicked. He intentionally stalls the plane (always good at breaking things), causing a free fall. Yara tells him she's sorry, but he never should have sought The Maze, then FIRES into the planes gas tank. 

The plane ERUPTS in fire. The fire spreads through the ELK herd, approaching SHIRLEY'S CAGE. She shrieks. 

Zayne moves toward her but then he sees ANNA, struggling with YARA, Yara's knife poised just over her neck.

GINA
Is that a goddman GUN on plane? Lady... I don't care what kind of animal trainer you think--

But Anna swing the gun to her, tells her to back off: //you don't know what you're getting into//.

It gives Z just a BEAT to make move. 

[[Try to escape->Bear on the Run]]
[[Don't get Shot by the Nice Lady->Scaredy Bear]]

:: SAVE SHIRLEY 
Zayne grabs the monkey just as Anna PULLS A GUN and empties the clip into YARA. <<set $annatrust to $annatrust +1>>

Yara stumbles back, smiling.

As we watch, her bullet wounds HEAL. Shirley shivers, crawls into Zayne's shirt.

She walks through the FLAMES towards ZAYNE, burning and healing, burning and healing all at once. 

She smiles at Zayne, going in for the kill but then Anna PULLS HER PARACHUTE, ripping Yara out of the plane. 

The plane TUMBLES, the fire grows. Zayne has no time to be shocked. 

There are two parachutes. Gina is passed out at the controls. Robby is dead. Pedro grabs one of the parachutes, hands shaking. 

He throws the other to Zayne. Tells him they have to jump. 

ZAYNE looks at the fire, looks back at the controls. The cockpit isn't burning. 

ZAYNE
I think we can put this out!

PEDRO
If we don't jump, everyone dies!

[[Jump]]
[[Put out Fire]]

:: SAVE ANNA 
Zayne tries to save Anna, but she doesn't need it. Before he gets to her, Anna PULLS A GUN and empties the clip into YARA. 

ANNA
Save the monkey, psycho!

As Zayne dives for the MONKEY, Yara stumbles back, smiling. 

As we watch, her bullet wounds HEAL. 

She walks through the FLAMES towards ZAYNE, burning and healing, burning and healing all at once. 

The plane TUMBLES, the fire grows. Zayne has no time to be shocked. 

As she move in for the KILL, Anna PULLS Yara parachute, RIPPING her out of the plane. 

Zayne looks impressed, but there's no time to think. 

The plane LURCHES. 

They look at the cockpit. Robby lies dead across the controls. Gina is passed out next to him. Pedro looks terrified. The fire is raging. Zayne has to put this out. 

He looks at Anna's gun, looks at a FIRE EXTINGUISHER at his feet.

He shakes his head, walks down toward [[The Plane|Go to the Plane]]

As they walk to the plane, Pedro looks down awkwardly. 

PEDRO
So uh... not to be personal or whatever, but why were you tied up in that friggen bear?

Zayne laughs, explains his situation. Brother's in trouble. I gotta help. 

PEDRO
Damn, yeah man. That's intense. 

Pedro tries to convince him that Anna is trouble. We gotta take away her gun.

(feeling like she's not going to get it)
It's... it's family. 

GINA
Yup. I hear that. My stepson?

She keep talking as Zayne carries the bear toward the shelter. Then, she stops him. 

She tells him she doens't trust either Pedro or Anna, but at least Anna's simple. She's a cop. If you're trying to get down here for some shady shit, she's probably here to arrest you or something. Either way, have to choose between them? I say choose the enemy you know.

Gina survives in this plot. 

But then, the sound of a HELICOPTER. 

Pedro called in reinforcements. 

You have to escape down an ice crevasse. 

Where you find an ARTIFACT detailing the collapse of civilizations.

Int. ice cave - night

Around the coals of a the dying fire, Shirley curls into Zayne's neck, sad that he's tied up. . 

She blinks, licks her mustache, happily grooming in the cozy cave. 

But then, she sees something. 

Pedro is sneaking behind the fire. She looks at him and growls. He tries to shush her, pawing at Zayne's face. 

He snores, snuggles deeper into sleep. 

Shirley looks back at Pedro. He's not waking up. 

Pedro presses a BUTTON, RUNS out of the ice cave. 

Shirley SCREAMS. 

Zayne and Anna wake up, see the BOMB

INT. ICE CAVE - NIGHT

While Zayne snores, Pedro gets Shirley to gnaw through his ropes. 

Freed, he crawls over to his bag, arms a BOMB. 

Shirley looks at Zayne, GROWLS. 

Pedro looks sad, whispers he's sorry. But this will be quick. 

The Bomb [[EXPLODES]]

The FIRE melts enough of the ice to see CAVE PAINTINGS showing extinction events.

For a beat, total silence. You think you died. 

But then Zayne crawls out of the snow. <<set $scarloc1 to "in an ice cave">>

He's missing a boot. He calls for Anna and Gina but can't find them. 

As he digs through the snow, he finds his FIRE STARTER<<if $takehergun is 0>> and Anna's satellite phone <</if>>. 

He doesn't know what to do. He calls HARPER. She asks if he's ok. He said he's made some mistakes. He'll be fine. Is she safe?

We see that there are NEWS CREWS at Tammy's house. Tammy is telling htem that whoever they were, they now have a fresh understanding of the power of first ammendment feminism. 

Harper laughs and says... we're totally safe. But then she asks. Dad... are you sure you're ok.

WIth only one boot, Zayne stumbles through the cold. 

The sharp rocks cut through his sock. He tries to bandage it, but he can barely feel anything. 

He tries pushing forward, but without sensation in his leg, he TRIPS. 

He tumbles down the mountain, sliding toward a RAVINE. 

CUT TO:

A HELICOPTER OVERHEAD

Zayne, unconscious is strapped to a gurney.

Harper and Tammy are there. He says he never found his brother, but that's ok. Somethings aren't meant to be. 

Then, through the window they see a MASSIVE TSUNAMI approaching. 

[[The Stakes are Higher than you think, better find your boot!->Find Your Other Boot]]

:: FIND YOUR OTHER BOOT 
He starts a FIRE, and after a long time digging, finds his boot. 

But as he LOOKS UP, he sees, revealed by the melting ice,  CAVE PAINTINGS showing extinction events. A crude prehistoric drawing of The Fanged Deity eating a village. 

Then, a NORTE CHICO carved relief of a more ABSTRACTED fanged deity swallowing the sea. 

Then, a GOLD PLATED HUGE DISC, showing an ELABORATE FANGED DEITY slicing a mountain in two. 

Alongside, there's little graffiti showing that people have come here over the centuries to survive these recurrant disaster events. 

Zayne recognizes the fanged deity from YARA's tattoo.  Have these people been wiping out civilizations for thousands of years?

The GROUND shifts under him. He has to climb out now. 

Has to climb down mountain alone. 



AVALANCHE sends him tumbling to the bottom. 

Calls his daughter. 

Realization: Maybe I don't rust anyone but myself. Then, backtracks. but end of hte day, I gotta trust my gut. 


So you and Malachi end up on Atoc's bad side. 

You need to be rescued by Tammy.

It is... it is definitely nice to hear your voice.  

It's not the confession of vulnerability that we were maybe hoping for, but  Harper knows how to interepret. Her dad's in trouble. 

HARPER
Remember that time I gut shot that big ol cow elk and lost her trail and it was gettin' dark and I felt so bad and started bawlin' like a little baby? Well, and remember how you just told me to take a breath, get my bearings, take it one step at a time and never ever ever give up?

ZAYNE
(clears his throat)
Yeah...

HARPER
Well I thought that was maybe pretty good advice. 

And just then, the phone GOES DEAD. 

ZAYNE shakes it, wiling it back to life. No dice. 

He sighs, defeated for a moment. He crosses himself against the cold. He's so alone. He's more scared than he wants to admit. He misses his kids. 

But then, through newly misty eyes, he looks <nobr><<if $scareloc1 is "on the side of a mountain">>out at the blinding snowstorm. He can't see anything. But then, a GUST reveals a SNOW BRIDGE over the chasm between him and the CAIRN.<<elseif $scareloc1 is "in an ice cave">>up.

But then, from outside the cave, the sound of HELICOPTERS. 

Pedro smiles. 

He tells Zayne he made a mistake trusting Anna, but he understands. It's for his brother. It's family. He'll forgive it. He's a member of the GUERILLA group who's //actually// been fighting to free Peru from colonialism. He can take Zayne to Malachi right now. He knows where he is.

Instead, she TACKLES him. 

She's strong but he's big, and he's got bear claws. 

As he BREAKS FREE,  Anna tries to stop him, but Zayne RIPS the emergency escape door open. 

ANNA
Wait. Wait! Just listen to me! Your brother... Malachi...

At Malachi's name, Zayne turns. Stunned. 

But the force of the wind grabs the BEAR HEAD, RIPPING HIM out of the plane, tumbling end over end. 

As he freefalls, Zayne fights with the parachute. Corn nuts, combos and pork rinds come STREAMING out of the suit. 

It rips ENTIRELY OFF HIS BODY, floating next to him. He has to use the BEAR SKIN to slow himself down enough to grab the pack, sling it over one shoulder

He wakes himself. This is bad, this is very, very bad. He pulls out Anna's phone.

:: UFO ENDING ANDES {"position":"1475,2425"}
ext. andes - 20,000 years in the future

A UFO whirs over the frozen Andean landscape. They are mere islands now... the only land masses on an earth whose oceans cover all the other continents.

ext. andes - crevasse

ALIEN ARCHEOLOGISTS carefully whisk snow away from the frozen bodies of Zayne, Shirley, and Anna, curled around each other.

ext. deep space

The UFO approaches their HOME PLANET.

int. UFO

The PERFECTLY EXTRACTED frozen block of ice that contains all three of them is wheeled into a CRYOGENIC chamber. 

ALIEN SCIENTISTS (robots with disgusting fleshy bits inside a domed helmet) look on in absolute wonder. 

ALIEN 1 
Behold, they are such a beautysense in my softest parts. Love like this hath surely never been seesmelled in the history of the big milk. A society whom doth not kill their males at birth, yet whom also holdeth tiny fureethings to their breasts? It is wonder. We must bless them with relife so they can teach us. 

One of ther other aliens recoils. 

ALIEN 2
This is heresy, sister! Relife can only be given to the sisterhood. No male, nor furreething can partake!

The first alien looks down, doesn't respond, but from her posture, it's clear this isn't settled. 

int. alien courtroom

An ALIEN JUDGE stands, reads a proclamation. 

ALIEN JUDGE
It has been ordered that any being who doth not harvest a male of their //onlypurpose// upon birth hath violated the deepest feelsense of the greater milk, and must be destroyed. Therefore, all icefrozen ones shall be melted into their atomic principles, purifying them of the shameful //malelove// and //furcomfort// we hath witnessed here. 

OUTSIDE THE COURT - chants rise. This isn't going well. 

CUT TO:

Ext. ALIEN BATTLE FIELD - the iceblock at the center. 

Alien troops DESTROY EACHOTHER with lazers and nukes. Weeping, nashing of teeth. 

Some of the troops carry a FLAG emblazoned with a man, woman and monkey locked in an infinite embrace. 

INT. cryogenic chamber. 

In the ice block, Z's frozen face looks uncomfortable. 

Overhead lights stutter to life. 

A SINGLE (Alien 1 from before, it's a big part) pulls herself into the chamber. She's bloody, tattered, barely alive. She wires up a MACHINE, and with her LAST BREATH, hits a BUTTON. 

Weird robots rise up, start to work on reassembling Zayne, Anna and Shirley. 

CUT TO:

ext. battlefield

HEAVY DOORS SLIDE OPEN to reveal: THE AFTERMATH of the battle. 

Zayne, Anna and Shirley look out onto this weird alien world. full of death and destruction. Three moons hang in the sky above them. 

ZAYNE
Howdy.

But then, his nose itches. He tries to stifle it he can't. 

He SNEEZES. Loud. A dad sneeze. 

For a beat, nothing. 

Then, one of the aliens sneezes. 

Another one sneezes. Then another. 

The first alien collapses. 

ANNA
Dammit, Z...

Like dominoes, the remaining Aliens die around them. 

Z looks up at the strange sky. The three moons, regretting everything. 

Maybe if he hadn't tried to be a hero... Maybe if he could have just admitted than Anna was too heavy for him to carry, [[HE WOULDN'T HAVE WIPED OUT AN ENTIRE ALIEN CIVILIZATION->LEAVE ANNA]]
